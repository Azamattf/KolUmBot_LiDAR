# KolUmBot
This repo is part of the KulUmBot project led by Florian Spiegel, M.Sc., at the Chair of Materials Handling, Material Flow, Logistics, Technical University of Munich. The purpose of this python repo of is to visualize the movement of a fleet of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) as well as the LiDAR point cloud generated by the sensors mounted on them.

## Data
The data is stored as JSON files generated via AMR simulation in the Unity environment. Each JSON file is a "snapshot" in time marked with a timestamp and contain RGB camera and/or LiDAR data. Every AMR has one or more camera and LiDAR sensors.

## Components of the repo
The various python codes process the data stored as JSON files and create graphs and animations for analysis purposes.
The breakdown of the those components can be found in the **docs** folder.

### 1. amr_trajectories
This script visualizes the movement trajectories of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) by processing JSON files containing position data and creating an animated 2D plot. The animation shows each robot's path over time with markers indicating their current positions.

## Current Development
At the moment, the work is underway to visualize simulated point clouds generated by LiDARs mounted on multiple AMRs (each robot has two of them). These point clouds will be moving with the robots as they traverse the environment and be color-coded to reflect the classes of objects they detect.
