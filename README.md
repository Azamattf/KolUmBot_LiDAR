# KolUmBot
This repo is part of the KulUmBot project led by Florian Spiegel, M.Sc., at the Chair of Materials Handling, Material Flow, Logistics, Technical University of Munich. The purpose of this python repo of is to visualize the movement of a fleet of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) as well as the LiDAR point cloud generated by the sensors mounted on them.

## Data
The data is stored as JSON files and images generated via AMR simulation in the Unity environment. Each JSON file is a "snapshot" in time marked with a timestamp and contain RGB camera and/or LiDAR data. Data represents one or more camera and LiDAR sensors mounted on each AMR. Note that not all JSON files contain both camera and LiDAR data since these two sensors have different sampling frequencies.

## Components of the repo
The various python codes process and manipulate the data and create graphs and animations for analysis purposes.
The breakdown of the those components can be found in the [docs folder](docs).

## Current Development
At the moment, the work should not be considered as fully complete as there is plenty room for improvement.
